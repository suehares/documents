<abstract>
   <t> This presents security-related requirements for the I2RS
   protocol for mutual authentication, transport protocols, 
   data transfer and transactions. 
   </t>
</abstract>
</front>
<middle>
<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
   <t>The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)  
   provides read and write access to information and state within the
    routing process. The I2RS client
	interacts with one or more I2RS agents to collect information
    from network routing systems. </t>
	<t> This document describes the requirements for the
	I2RS protocol in the security-related areas of mutual authentication of the 
	I2RS client and agent, the transport protocol carrying the I2RS 
	protocol messages, and the atomicity of the transactions. 
    These requirements align with the description of the I2RS architecture found in
	<xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture"></xref> document which solves the problem
	described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-problem-statement"></xref>.</t>
	<t>
	  <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-ephemeral-state"></xref> discusses I2RS roles-based write 
	  conflict resolution in the ephemeral data store using the I2RS Client Identity, I2RS Secondary Identity 
	  and priority. The draft <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability"></xref> describes the traceability
	  framework and its requirements for I2RS.  The draft <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements"></xref>
	  describes the requirements for I2RS to be able to publish information or have a remote client subscribe to an 
	  information data stream.  
	  </t> 

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

<section title="Definitions" >
   <t>This document utilizes the definitions found in the
   following documents:  <xref target="RFC4949"></xref> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture"></xref>
   </t> 
  <t> Specifically, this document utilizes the following definitions:
  <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="access control"><vspace blankLines="1"/> <xref target="RFC4949" /> defines 
	access control as the following:
	<list> 
	<t>
	1. (I) Protection of system resources against unauthorized access.
	</t>
        <t>
        2. (I) A process by which use of system resources is regulated
        according to a security policy and is permitted only by authorized
        entities (users, programs, processes, or other systems) according
        to that policy. (See: access, access control service, computer
        security, discretionary access control, mandatory access control,
        role-based access control.)
        </t>
        <t>
        3. (I) /formal model/ Limitations on interactions between subjects
        and objects in an information system.
        </t>
        <t>
        4. (O) "The prevention of unauthorized use of a resource,
        including the prevention of use of a resource in an unauthorized
        manner." [I7498-2]
        </t>
        <t>
        5. (O) /U.S. Government/ A system using physical, electronic, or
        human controls to identify or admit personnel with properly
        authorized access to a SCIF.
        </t>
	  </list> </t>
	<t hangText="Authentication"><vspace blankLines="1"/>  <xref target="RFC4949" />
	 describes authentication as the process of verifying (i.e., establishing the truth of) 
	 an attribute value claimed by or for a system entity or system
	 resource. Authentication has two steps: identify and verify. </t>
	<t hangText="Data Confidentiality"><vspace blankLines="1"/>  <xref target="RFC4949" />
	describes data confidentiality as having two properties:
	<list style="hanging">
	<t>a) Data is not disclosed to system entities unless they have been
	authorized to know the data, and 
	</t>
	<t>b) Data is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities or
	processes.
	</t>
	</list>
	The key point is that
	confidentiality implies that the originator has the ability to authorize where the 
	information goes.  Confidentiality is important for both read and write scope of the 
	data.</t>
	<t hangText="Data Integrity"><vspace blankLines="1"/> <xref target="RFC4949" />
      states data integrity includes:
	  <list>
	    <t>
	    1. (I) The property that data has not been changed, destroyed, or
	    lost in an unauthorized or accidental manner. [...]
	    </t>
	    <t>
	    2. (O) "The property that information has not been modified or
            destroyed in an unauthorized manner." [I7498-2]
            </t>
	  </list>
	  </t> 
	<t hangText="Data Privacy"><vspace blankLines="1"/> <xref target="RFC4949" /> describes
	data privacy as a synonym for data confidentiality. This I2RS document will utilize
	data privacy as a synonym for data confidentiality. </t> 
	<t hangText="Mutual Authentication"><vspace blankLines="1"/><xref target="RFC4949" />
	 implies that mutual authentication exists between two interacting system
	 entities.  Mutual authentication in I2RS implies that both sides move from
	 a state of mutual suspicion to mutually authenticated communication after
	 each system has been identified and validated by its peer system.</t>
	<t hangText="role"><vspace blankLines="1"/> <xref target="RFC4949" /> describes role as: 
	<list>
	  <t>
	  1. (I) A job function or employment position to which people or
          other system entities may be assigned in a system. [...]
          </t>
	  <t>
	  2. (O) /Common Criteria/ A pre-defined set of rules establishing
          the allowed interactions between a user and the TOE.
          </t>
	</list> 
	The I2RS uses the common criteria definition. 
	</t> 
	<t hangText="role-based access control"><vspace blankLines="1"/> <xref target="RFC4949" /> describes role-based 
     access control as: "A form of identity-based access control wherein the system
      entities that are identified and controlled are functional
      positions in an organization or process."
	  </t> 
	<t hangText="security audit trail"><vspace blankLines="1"/><xref target="RFC4949" /> describes
	a security audit trail as "A chronological record of system activities that is sufficient
      to enable the reconstruction and examination of the sequence
      environments and activities surrounding or leading to an
      operation, procedure, or event in a security-relevant transaction
      from inception to final results."
      </t>
      <t>Requirements to support a security audit is not covered in this
      document.</t>
      <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability"></xref> describes traceability for I2RS interface and 
	   the I2RS protocol. Traceability is not equivalent to a security audit trail. </t>
	</list>
	</t>
	<t>
	<list style="hanging">

</section>
<section title="Security-Related Requirements" >
<t> The security for the I2RS protocol requires mutually authenticated I2RS clients and I2RS agents.
The I2RS client and I2RS agent using the I2RS protocol MUST be able to exchange 
data over a secure transport, but some functions may operate on a non-secure
transport. The I2RS protocol MUST be able to provide atomicity of a transaction, but it is 
not required to have multi-message atomicity and roll-back mechanism transactions.  Multiple messages
<!-- XXX JMH - The sentence about multi-message atomicity and roll-back is awkwardly stated. Consider re-wording. -->
transactions may be impacted by the interdependency of data. This section discusses the 
details of these security requirements. 
</t> 
<section title="Mutual authentication of an I2RS client and an I2RS Agent ">  
<t>The I2RS architecture <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture"></xref>
sets the following requirements:  
<list style="symbols">
<!-- XXX JMH - section 4.1 of the architecture suggests that applications should have unique identifiers.  The direct correlation between an application and a client is not firmly stated. -->
<t>SEC-REQ-01: All I2RS clients and I2RS agents MUST have at least one unique identifier that uniquely identifies
each party. </t>
<t>SEC-REQ-02: The I2RS protocol MUST utilize these identifiers for mutual identification of
the I2RS client and I2RS agent. </t>
<!-- XXX JMH - "message" below is ambiguous within the context of our document set.  Suggest clarifying -->
<t>SEC-REQ-03: An I2RS agent, upon receiving an I2RS message from a
I2RS client, MUST confirm that the I2RS client has a valid identifier.</t>
<t>SEC-REQ-04: The I2RS client, upon receiving an I2RS message from an
I2RS agent, MUST confirm the I2RS agent has a valid identifier.</t>
 <t>SEC-REQ-05: Identifier distribution and the loading of these identifiers into I2RS agent
 and I2RS Client SHOULD occur outside the I2RS protocol. </t>
 <t>SEC-REQ-06: The I2RS protocol SHOULD assume some mechanism (IETF or private) will
 distribute or load identifiers so that the I2RS client/agent has these
 identifiers prior to the I2RS protocol establishing a connection 
 between I2RS client and I2RS agent. </t>
<t> SEC-REQ-07: Each Identifier MUST be linked to exactly one priority.</t>
<!-- XXX JMH - the conditional but clause below could use restating. -->
<t> SEC-REQ-08: Each Identifier is associated with one secondary identifier during a particular read/write
sequence, but the secondary identifier may vary during the time a connection
between the I2RS client and I2RS agent is active. The variance of the
secondary identifier allows the I2RS client to be associated with multiple
applications and pass along an identifier for these applications in the 
secondary identifier.   </t>
</list>
</t>
</section> 
<section title="Transport Requirements Based on Mutual Authentication" >
<t>SEC-REQ-09: The I2RS protocol MUST be able to transfer data over a
   secure transport and optionally MAY be able to transfer data over a
   non-secure transport.  A secure transport MUST provide data
   confidentiality, data integrity, and replay prevention.
</t> 
<t>
The default transport is a secure transport. 
</t> 
<t>
<!-- XXX JMH - No specific discussion about how such flagging of non-confidentiality in the data model has been previously discussed. This is potentially a large oversight. -->
Note: The non-secure transport can be used for publishing telemetry data or other operational state that was specifically indicated to
non-confidential in the data model.
</t>
<t>The configuration of ephemeral data in the I2RS Agent by the 
I2RS client SHOULD be done over a secure transport. It is anticipated that the passing of most I2RS 
ephemeral state operational status SHOULD be done over a secure transport.  
Data models SHOULD clearly annotate what data nodes can be passed over an insecure connection.
<!-- XXX JMH - what should happen if a data node that is annotated as secure is attempted to be passed over an insecure transport? This has protocol implications. -->
</t>
<t>
SEC-REQ-10: A secure transport MUST be associated with a key management 
solution that can guarantee that only the entities having sufficient privileges 
can get the keys to encrypt/decrypt the sensitive data.  
Per <xref target="RFC4107">BCP107</xref> this key management system SHOULD be automatic, 
but MAY be manual in the following scenarios:
<list>
<t>a) The environment has limited bandwidth or high round-trip times.</t>  
<t>b) The information being protected has low value.</t>
<t>c) The total volume of traffic over the entire lifetime of the long-term session key will be very low.</t>
<t>d) The scale of the deployment is limited.</t>
</list>
</t>
<t>
Most I2RS environments (Clients and Agents) will not have the environment
described by <xref target="RFC4107">BCP107</xref> but a few I2RS use cases 
required limited non-secure light-weight telemetry messages
that have these requirements.  An I2RS data model must indicate which portions can be
served by manual key management. 
</t>
<t> SEC-REQ-11: The I2RS protocol MUST be able to support multiple secure transport
sessions providing protocol and data communication between an I2RS Agent
and an I2RS client.  However, a single I2RS Agent to I2RS client connection MAY
elect to use a single secure transport session or a single 
non-secure transport session. </t>
<t>SEC-REQ-12: The I2RS Client and I2RS Agent protocol SHOULD implement
mechanisms that mitigate DoS attacks </t>  
</section>
<section title="Data Confidentiality Requirements"> 
<t>SEC-REQ-13: In a critical infrastructure, certain data within routing elements is
sensitive and read/write operations on such data MUST be controlled in order to protect 
its confidentiality.  For example, most carriers do not want a router's 
configuration and data flow statistics known by hackers or their competitors.  
While carriers may share peering information, most carriers do not share 
configuration and traffic statistics. To achieve this, access control to sensitive
data needs to be provided, and the confidentiality protection on
 such data during transportation needs to be enforced. </t>
</section>
<section title="Data Integrity Requirements">
<t> SEC-REQ-14: An integrity protection mechanism for I2RS SHOULD be able to ensure the following: 
<list>
<t>1) The data being protected is not modified without detection during 
its transportation and 
</t>
<t>2) The data is actually from where it is expected to come from 
</t>
<t>3) The data is not repeated from some earlier interaction of the protocol.
That is, when both confidentiality and integrity of data is properly protected, it 
is possible to ensure that encrypted data is not modified
or replayed without detection. </t>
</list>
</t>
<t>SEC-REQ-15: The integrity that the message data is not repeated
means that I2RS client to I2RS agent transport SHOULD protect against replay attack </t>
<t>Requirements SEC-REQ-13 and SEC-REQ-14 are SHOULD requirements only because it is recognized
that some I2RS Client to I2RS agent communication occurs over a non-secure channel. 
The I2RS client to I2RS agent over a secure channel would implement these features. 
In order to provide some traceability or notification for the non-secure protocol,
SEC-REQ-16 suggests traceability and notification are important to include for
any non-secure protocol.</t>
<t>SEC-REQ-16: The I2RS message traceability and notification requirements 
requirements found in <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-traceability"></xref> and
<xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements"></xref> SHOULD be supported 
in communication channel that is non-secure to trace or notify about potential
security issues.</t>
</section>
 <section title="Role-Based Data Model Security">
 <t>The <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture">I2RS Architecture</xref> defines a 
role or security role as specifying read, write, or notification access by a I2RS client to
data within an agent's data model.  
</t>
<t> SEC-REQ-17: The rules around what role is permitted to access and manipulate what 
information plus a secure transport (which protects the data in transit)  
SHOULD ensure that data of any level of sensitivity is 
reasonably protected from being observed by those without permission 
to view it, so that privacy requirements are met.
</t>
 <t> SEC-REQ-18: Role security MUST work when multiple transport connections are being used
 between the I2RS client and I2RS agent as the <xref target="I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture">I2RS architecture</xref> states. 
 These transport message streams may start/stop without affecting the existence of the client/agent
 data exchange.  TCP supports a single stream of data. SCTP <xref target="RFC4960" /> provides
 security for multiple streams plus end-to-end transport of data. 
 </t> 
<t> SEC-REQ-19: I2RS clients MAY be used by multiple applications to configure routing 
 via I2RS agents, receive status reports, turn on the I2RS audit stream, or turn 
 on I2RS traceability.  Application software using I2RS client functions
 may host multiple secure identities, but each connection will use
 only one identifier with one priority.  Therefore, the security of each 
 I2RS Client to I2RS Agent connection is unique. 
 </t>
 <t> Please note the security of the application to 
 I2RS client connection is outside of the I2RS protocol or I2RS interface.
